# Data Structures Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures Repository! 🚀 This repository serves as a collection of data structure problems and concepts that I solve and explore. The goal is to enhance my understanding of fundamental and advanced data structures while building an organized reference for future use.

## 📌 Repository Overview

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various data structures, including but not limited to:

Arrays
Patterns
BinaryTrees
Bitmasking
Mathematics
Recusrion

Advanced Data Structures (Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, etc.)

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding solutions, optimizing code, or improving explanations! Create a pull request, and I’ll be happy to review it. 😊
